## Description
It's a project that tends to increase our skills for dealling with routing and Serve/Client 
connection through importing a weather information for any country through accessing one of 
the common weather APIs, then store that data and post it to the server then request it 
back and using it to update the application UserInterface. 

## Requirements

1. Integrating `OpenWeatherMap` API to get the Weather Infromation dynmicly from it.

2. Use the `user inputs` to get the correct API URL.

3. Store the imported Data from the online weather map API.

4. Create a `server` that the client will interface with. 

5. `Post` the stored Data to the server saving it to the project end point.

6. `Retrieve` the Data again from the Server to the `client side`.

7. Use the retrieved Data to `Update the Application UI dynamically`.
